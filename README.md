## Summary of Logged Data

| Data File | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| dailyActivity_merged.csv | Daily steps, calories, intensity |
| sleepDay_merged.csv | Sleep duration and quality |
| minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv | Minute-level intensity data |
| dailyIntensities_merged.csv | Light, moderate, vigorous intensity |
| weightLogInfo_merged.csv | Weight and BMI logs |

##  Data Cleaning & Processing (SQL)

- Removed null and duplicate rows
- Verified date formats and negative values
- Aggregated intensity and calorie columns
- Joined key tables for comprehensive analysis

---

##  Visualizations

###  Python
- Calories burned per day (line plot)
- Sleep duration vs calories (scatter plot)
- Steps over time (bar plot)
- Intensity levels (stacked bar chart)

###  Power BI
- Daily activity dashboard
- Sleep patterns
- Correlation between steps, intensity, and calories

---

##  Key Insights

- Users who sleep 7+ hours tend to burn more calories
- Peak activity times fall between 6–8 AM and 6–8 PM
- Step count strongly correlates with overall calorie burn
- Low vigorous activity levels suggest need for motivation

---

##  Recommendations

- Design in-app reminders to encourage vigorous activity
- Promote better sleep habits through app insights
- Target users with customized health tips and reward systems
